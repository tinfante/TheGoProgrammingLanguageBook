The catwalk has bumps to resemble the tracks of Guitar Hero.]]\nWhen I'm in a rock band, I'm gonna do a cool, mellow song. Then in the middle I'll stop, announce \"this part is just to be an asshole to people playing Guitar Hero,\" and then flail wildly on the strings for 30 seconds.\n{{Title Text: And then do it again in a moment now that they're out of Star Power}}",
