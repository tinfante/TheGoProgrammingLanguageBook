They're awful. Defy all rules of composition.\nWhat are you suggesting?\nMaybe there is a god, but he's a real art lover.\nThis is why I don't go out in public with you.\n{{Alt text: So he's saying that God thought Hitler's art was so bad that the Holocaust was an acceptable alternative.  It's no secret that the hat guy is closely based on Aram, from Men in Hats.}}",
