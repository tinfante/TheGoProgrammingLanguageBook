What's interesting is that there doesn't seem to be any reason this should be true. One could imagine an extremely large object with lots of resistance to force and no gravity (or vice versa), but this is never observed.\nHat Guy: You know what? I'm just gonna skip the rest of the buildup and say it: Yo mama's fat.\n{{alt: She's so fat the attraction goes up as the CUBE of the distance instead of the square}}",
